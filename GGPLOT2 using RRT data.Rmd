```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## 1. Create new project and folder structure 

We start this anaysis by creating a new project called **ggplot2-visualizations** and withing this project we use the above function to create the folder structure required to store input and output files

```{r Setup project folder structure,echo=TRUE}
library(here)

project_setup <-function(){
  
  if(!dir.exists("data")){dir.create(here("data"))}
  if(!dir.exists("plots")){dir.create(here("plots"))}
  if(!dir.exists("Archive")){dir.create(here("Archive"))}
  if(!dir.exists("Test")){dir.create(here("Test"))}

} 

# Run code below to use function and create folder structure
project_setup()
```


## 2. Data used for building plots

We are going to explore how to build GGPLOT2 plots using RTT data.

[RTT_Waiting_Times]<https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/rtt-waiting-times/rtt-data-2022-23/>

In particular we will be focusing on the England-level time series. The file can be found in the website below:

England-level time series: 
- RTT Overview Timeseries Including Estimates for Missing Trusts Nov2022 (XLS,98k)

![RTT main stats website](C:/R_WDP/ggplot2-visualizations/plots/RTT data website.png)
To download the England level time series we can look at the URL address where the .csv file is saved: 

In Firefox we do that by by clicking on the three lines menus on the top right corner, then selecting More tools and finally we selet  **Page Source**

```{r Source code including RTT data, echo=TRUE}
URL <-c('<p><strong>England-level time series</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/RTT-Overview-Timeseries-Including-Estimates-for-Missing-Trusts-Nov22-XLS-98K-63230.xlsx">RTT Overview Timeseries Including Estimates for Missing Trusts Nov22 (XLS, 98K)</a></p>')
URL
```
As can asee in the HTTP code above, the href tag will provide us with the .xlsx file that is published and uploaded to the RTT waiting times series [RTT_Waiting_Times]<https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/rtt-waiting-times/rtt-data-2022-23/>


## 3. Load data into R from online CSV files

We will download an .xlsx file from an URL into our /data project sub-folder

Download RTT Time series data using this code below into our data sub-folder.

- Time series data
- CHROME: Inspect element. Copy outher HTML
- We can find the .csv data by looking at <href> tags in the HTML code
- <p><strong>England-level time series</strong></p>
- <p><a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/RTT-Overview-Timeseries-Including-Estimates-for-Missing-Trusts-Nov22-XLS-98K-63230.xlsx">RTT Overview Timeseries Including Estimates for Missing Trusts Nov22 (XLS, 98K)</a></p>'

Template to load xlsx file from URL
- urlFile = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SF0PkBz9BR4yqiQ27Bt5OsD33Y8Rt5lh/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107152468748636733235&rtpof=true&sd=true"
- xlsFile = "refugios_nayarit.xlsx"
- download.file(url=urlFile, destfile=xlsFile, mode="wb")


```{r First check your project folder}
library(here)
here()
```

```{r Download data from URL, echo=TRUE}
# Template to load xlsx file from URL
# urlFile = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SF0PkBz9BR4yqiQ27Bt5OsD33Y8Rt5lh/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107152468748636733235&rtpof=true&sd=true"
# xlsFile = "refugios_nayarit.xlsx"
# download.file(url=urlFile, destfile=xlsFile, mode="wb")

RTT_TS_data <- function() {
  
  if(!dir.exists("data")){dir.create("data")}
  
  # England-level time series
  # Download Excel file to a Project sub-folder called "data"
  # Created previously using an adhoc project structure function
  
  xlsFile = "RTT_TS_data.xlsx"
  
  download.file(
    url = 'https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/RTT-Overview-Timeseries-Including-Estimates-for-Missing-Trusts-Nov22-XLS-98K-63230.xlsx',
    destfile = here("data",xlsFile),
    mode ="wb"
  )

}
# Download RTT data function (no arguments)
RTT_TS_data()
```

As we can see below, the Excel file has been downloaded to our data folder

## 4. Import Excel file into R 

We need to skip some rows and select just a handful of columns from the original Excel file we import into R. We use
